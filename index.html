        “I cannot say and I will not say That he is dead, he is just away. With
        a cheery smile and a wave of hand He has wandered into another land; And
        left us dreaming how very fair Its needs must be, since he lingers
        there. And you-oh you, who the wildest yearn From the old-time step and
        the glad return- Think of him faring on, as dear In the love of there,
        as the love of here Think of him still the same way, I say; He is not
        dead, he is just away.”
